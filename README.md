# Capstone Project Review

## Introduction

This document describes how your Capstone project will be reviewed. Your teachers may also provide additional or alternative information about the Capstone project review process, which you should follow. If you have any questions about this process, please discuss them with your teachers.

## The Project Task

Please see the Capstone task in Learn.co (or shared by your teacher, if applicable).

## The Project Review

You have until the middle of the second Capstone week to create and submit your Minimum Viable Product, which includes your project repo and presentation. Please submit the link to your project repo via the Learn.co assignment tool. Project submissions will be reviewed by your teachers by the end of the week.

Teachers will use [this project rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YUC5_QVu8BEd7xBJumzspH40-KuJtL9KQInQYXGi5bE/edit?usp=sharing) to grade your submission and presentation. Elements on the "Need to Have" sheet contribute to your score, while elements on the "Nice to Have" sheet are not scored. You will receive a final 1-5 score based on the rating for each "Need to Have" element. A score of 3 or higher is considered passing.

* 1: Less than half of elements are rated "Minimum Viable Product" or better
* 2: Half or more elements are rated "Minimum Viable Product" or better
* 3: All elements are rated "Minimum Viable Product" or better
* 4: All elements are rated "Minimum Viable Product" or better, half or more elements are rated "Complete Project"
* 5: All elements are rated "Complete Project"

If your project does not score a 3 or higher on the first review, you will have an option to re-submit your project in the middle of the final week for a second review. Your project must pass this second review for you to graduate with your cohort. If your project does not pass this second review, your teachers may give you the option to continue working on the project and re-submit it for a final review after the cohort graduates.

## Summary

This project will give you a valuable opportunity to create your own portfolio-ready project to showcase your data science skills to employers. Completing this project means that you are ready to succeed in your data science job search. We encourage you to reach out to your teachers if you have any questions. You've got this!
